Hello, I’m Chase Balmer, a fourth-year Computer Science student at RIT.

For the first half of 2025, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at MKS Instruments, where I developed backend software that supported production processes. My work centered around .NET development, building internal systems for our production backend system. 

Over the summer of 2025, I continued developing Project Lionheart, a full-stack athletic training data platform designed to model and analyze training, recovery, lifestyle, and injury data within a unified system. Built in .NET 9 with Entity Framework Core and SQLite, with a SvelteKit frontend, the platform emphasizes strong data modeling, clear service boundaries, and extensibility. I implemented an LLM-powered chat interface that accesses application data exclusively through controlled internal tools, with server-side validation and execution. This project has been an invaluable learning platform, deepening my skills in prompt engineering, LLM integration, LLM tool calling, agentic flows, and Model Context Protocol.

Over the summer of 2023, I worked as a Junior Software Developer at Lattice Ventures. LV is a startup software company developing a product for use in the legal field. The team consisted of highly skilled, senior professionals who were incredibly supportive in guiding me through challenging tasks and providing valuable feedback on my work.

Outside of software development, I am a part of the RIT Barbell Club, where I help foster both physical and mental strength within our community. I am an active mountain biker, backpacker, hiker, and movement advocate. 

My dedication has been recognized through the Dean’s List every semester, the RIT Presidential Scholarship, and the Innovation and Creativity Award Scholarship. My immersion is in Science, Technology, and Society, where I explore the broader context of technology’s impact.

I’m passionate about software development, AI, and the intersection of technology and human performance. With a foundation in both industry experience and entrepreneurial projects, I’m excited to contribute to impactful, forward-looking teams.
