Hello, I'm Chase Balmer, a third-year Computer Science student at RIT (fourth year junior/senior on paper). I am seeking an internship to apply my knowledge, contribute to a dynamic team, and gain real-world experience in the field of technology. I am looking for an internship during or spanning from January 2025-December 2025.<br>

Over the summer of 2023, I worked as a Junior Software Developer at Lattice Ventures. LV is a startup software company developing a product for use in the legal field. The team consisted of highly skilled, senior professionals who were incredibly supportive in guiding me through challenging tasks and providing valuable feedback on my work.<br>

Over the summer of 2024, I have been individually developing a fully fleshed out application. This application, named Lionheart, is an athletic training data hub. It allows users to store all of their training data in one location, allowing for easy analysis of personal trends and results. This project has been extremely fulfilling, teaching, and crucial in developing my skills in the field of software development. Working full stack has allowed me to further my experience on both fronts. <br>

I also play a leadership role in the RIT Barbell Club, fostering physical and mental strength within our community. My natural leadership, strong communication, and determination drive me.<br>

My commitment to excellence led to Dean's List for every semester I have been at RIT, along with the RIT Presidential Scholarship and the Innovation and Creativity Award Scholarship. Currently, my immersion is in the Science, Technology, and Society program.<br>

With practical software development experience, I excel in teamwork and problem-solving. I'm passionate about technology's impact and open to exciting opportunities. Let's connect and explore possibilities together!<br>
